The flower shop, with its white-washed facade adorned with cascading ivy and window boxes overflowing with colourful blooms, stood as a beacon of beauty and tranquillity in the quaint, secluded town of Goodflower.

The soft chime of a bell announced the arrival of a visitor as they stepped through the wooden door, greeted by a captivating dance of fragrances that filled the air.

It has only been a couple of weeks since you first arrived in town, but as their new Florist you were quickly able to gain the acceptance of the locals, and in turn, their patronage.
